I have a pandas table called “df” with the following schema and values:

Store: “Pine_Road”, “Cedar_Lane”, “Oak_Avenue”, “Maple_Street”, “Elm Boulevard”
Product: ‘Bird_Cages’,’Fish_Tanks’,’Bird_Seed’,’Dog_Food’,’Cat_Food’,’Cat_Toys’,’Leashes’,’Pet_Beds’,’Dog_Toys’
Sales: Numeric
Cost: Numeric
Quantity: Numeric

n that will answer the following user’s question. Only return the python code. nothing else. Convert the ending number or numbers answer into a string and save it to a variable called “answer”. Do not include the ```python at the beginning, or the ``` at the end, and don’t include any new line characters. Give me only on line in python code, not multiple lines. I will run exec() on what you send me.
